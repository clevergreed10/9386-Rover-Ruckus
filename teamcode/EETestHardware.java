/**
 * Pushbot Hardware Class
 *
 * This class can be used to define all the specific hardware for a single robot.
 * In this case that robot is a Pushbot.
 * See PushbotTeleopTank_Iterative and others classes starting with "Pushbot" for usage examples.
 *
 * This hardware class assumes the following device names have been configured on the robot:
 * Note:  All names are lower case and some have single spaces between words.
 *
 * Rev IMU:
 *
 * Motor channel:  Front right drive motor:  "wheel1"
 * Motor channel:  Front left drive motor:   "wheel2"
 * Motor channel:  Back left drive motor:    "wheel3"
 * Motor channel:  Back left drive motor:    "wheel4"
 * Motor channel:  Arm motor:                "armMotor"
 * Motor channel;  Winch drive motor:        "winch"
 *
 * Servo channel:  Servo to open left claw:  "left_hand"
 * Servo channel:  Servo to open right claw: "right_hand"
